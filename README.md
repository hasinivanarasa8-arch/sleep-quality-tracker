📊 Trend Graph (Matplotlib)


🌟 Why I Built This Project

I created this project because I’ve always been curious about how AI can improve healthcare and everyday wellbeing. Even though I’m from an MPC background, my interest in biology hasn’t faded. I wanted to build something practical—something that helps people reflect on their habits.

Sleep affects memory, focus, mood, stress levels, productivity—basically everything.
This project reflects my motive to use AI + data to make life healthier and easier.

🧩 What This Project Does

✔ Collects sleep & lifestyle inputs
✔ Calculates a sleep score out of 100
✔ Logs each day’s entry into a JSON file
✔ Plots score trends using Matplotlib
✔ Gives practical suggestions
✔ Provides a simple and clean Streamlit UI
